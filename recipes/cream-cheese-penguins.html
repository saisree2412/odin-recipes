    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Just imagine a cute display of penguins, 
       made with black olives, carrots and cream 
       cheese! You can add scarves and hats by 
       using fresh red pepper strips, or canned 
       pimentos cut into different shapes. Use 
       frilly toothpicks if you can. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>18 jumbo black olives, pitted</li>
        <li>1(8 ounce)package cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>18 small black olives</li>
        <li>1 carrot</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut a slit from top to bottom, 
            lengthwise, into the side of each jumbo
            olive. Carefully insert about 1 teaspoon
            of cream cheese into each olive. Slice the
            carrot into eighteen 1/4 inch thick rounds;
            cut a small notch out of each carrot slice to
            form feet. Save the cut out piece and press 
            into center of small olive to form the beak. 
            If necessary cut a small slit into each olive 
            before inserting the beak.</li>
        <li>Set a big olive, large hole side down, 
            onto a carrot slice. Then, set a small 
            olive onto the large olive, adjusting 
            so that the beak, cream cheese chest 
            and notch in the carrot slice line up. 
            Secure with a toothpick.</li>
    </ol>
